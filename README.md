Wai not?

This is my first try on MVI architecture so be gentle :)
Choosen the architecture path instead of fancy UI.


*Heavily* inspired by google todo mvi sample.


Overview:


Mvi as a main choice of architecture - to learn it :)

Dagger for dependency injection - just because everyone use it 

Databinding for UI - as I like it

Kakao for instrumented tests - because espresso is a tornment
